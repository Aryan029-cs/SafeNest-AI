# 🛡️ SafeNest AI – Intelligent Personal Safety System

SafeNest AI is an AI-powered personal safety platform designed to provide **instant emergency assistance, real-time alerts, and community-driven protection**.

The system uses **AI distress detection, live GPS tracking, and volunteer matching** to ensure quick response during dangerous situations.

Built for **hackathon innovation**, SafeNest AI demonstrates how technology and community support can improve personal safety.

# 🚀 Problem Statement

Many people face unsafe situations where **quick help is unavailable**.
Traditional emergency systems are slow, and nearby help often goes unnoticed.

SafeNest AI solves this by providing:

• Instant SOS alerts
• AI-based distress detection
• Real-time location sharing
• Nearby volunteer response network

---

# 💡 Our Solution

SafeNest AI creates an **AI-assisted safety ecosystem** that connects users, volunteers, and emergency responders.

When danger is detected or SOS is triggered:

1. The system detects distress signals.
2. User location is captured instantly.
3. Alerts are sent to nearby volunteers.
4. Emergency response begins in real time.

# ✨ Key Features

### 🚨 Smart SOS System

One-tap SOS button sends an emergency alert with user location.

### 🎤 AI Distress Detection

AI listens for distress signals (screams / panic sounds) and can automatically trigger alerts.

### 📍 Live GPS Tracking

Real-time location sharing allows responders to reach the user quickly.

### 👥 Volunteer Network

Nearby volunteers are matched and notified instantly.

### 📞 Fake Call Mode

Users can trigger a fake call to escape uncomfortable or unsafe situations.

### 📊 Threat Detection Meter

AI UI indicator that visualizes potential risk level.

---

# 🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ User presses the **SOS button** or distress is detected.

2️⃣ Frontend sends request to backend API.

3️⃣ Backend processes the alert and retrieves location.

4️⃣ Nearby volunteers are matched.

5️⃣ Emergency alerts are dispatched.
